Communication is important in aspects of life. Through communication, people can express their ideas, and thoughts to others. However, people with disabilities such as hearing or speaking impairment have difficulty communicating with other people, especially 'normal' people.

As for today people with disabilities still face communication issues in the public, the difficulties of people with disabilities are felt because not all normal people understand the language that is used by people with disabilities such as sign language.

Our aim with slinguage is to facilitate communication for persons with disabilities in the public areas.
